```
**_You can now add default_linemode devicons to your rc.conf_**

+ **Install Ueberzug(use for preview images in ranger)**:
    - Ubuntu(Note you may experience your images being badly placed this is because pip doesn't have the newest version of ueberzug, if you find this issue please install from source)

Ranger config file:
make sure you create a ranger config file and at least add the following lines
```bash

```

Add this configuration to rc.conf

default_linemode devicons

## general shortcuts
Use `alt` + hjkl to resize windows

Use `ctrl` + hjkl to navigate windows

Use `ctrl` `u` over word for make it Uppercase

You can execute python, sh, Javascript code in neovim with `leader` `r`

TAB in general mode will move to next buffer SHIFT-TAB will go back

alternative save&quit :
   - Use  `ctrl` `s` => save (:w) 
   - `ctrl` `Q` save and quite(:wq!)

Use `ctrl` `c` instead of escape


## Extenction config
### lsp
Recently I switch lsp over coc, and here is some shortcuts and configuration of my lsp.

`gd`  go to definition.

`gD`  go to declaration.

`gr`  go to references.

`gi`  go to implementation.

`K`   Hover and show more additional information.

`ctrl` `n` go to next diagnostic.

`ctrl` `p` go to previous diagnostic.

also auto formate is active for '.py' '.js' '.jsx' files

for install language see this [link](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)

### Emmet

my command to trigger the Emmet’s magic is: `,,` (comma comma) , simple and close to the fingers!

examples:

type `html:5` in INSERT mode then press comma two time `,,` like this gif
![](gifs/emmet-1.gif)

also you can create tags like `div` or custome tag like `myname` like this gif
![](gifs/emmet-2.gif)

let’s add a `<div>` with a `<p>` inside, that contains a link `<a href="">` for this example we use `>` operator so just type `div>p>a` and `,,` see this gif
![](gifs/emmet-3.gif)

You can define html attributes to the elements using the same convention used by CSS.

Let’s try with the previous example, adding a `.container` class to the `<div>`, a `#foo` id to the `<p>` tag.
type `div.container>p#foo>a` and `,,`
![](gifs/emmet-4.gif)

Let’s say you want a <div> with 5 `<p>` inside of it, just go with `div>p*5`:

### MarkdownPreview
I use markdown-preview plugin for preview markdown in neovim and it's work really well.

use `:MarkdownPreview` or `leader` `p` to see the preview in your default browser.

more information about [markdown-preview plugin](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim
).

---

### FZF
FZF is awesome tool for use inside neovim and It's much much more faster than ranger and coc-explorer. here is shortcuts and fzf commands.

* use `leader` `f` to open `:Files` where you can search for your files.
* `leader` `b` or `:Buffers` for search in your open buffer.
* `leader` `g` or `:Rg` search for mach result in files content and file name.
* `leader` `t` or `:Tags` search for Tags
* `leader` `m` or `:Marks` search for marks

also you can open files in split or new tab.
* tab split : `ctrl` `t`
* split     : `ctrl` `x`
* vsplit    : `ctrl` `v`

### nvim-tree
A File Explorer For Neovim Written In Lua.

**keybindings**:
   - move around like in any vim buffer
   - `<CR>` or `o` on `..` will cd in the above directory
   - `<C-]>` will cd in the directory under the cursor
   - `<BS>` will close current opened directory or parent
   - type `a` to add a file. Adding a directory requires leaving a leading `/` at the end of the path.
     > you can add multiple directories by doing foo/bar/baz/f and it will add foo bar and baz directories and f as a file
   - type `r` to rename a file
   - type `<C-r>` to rename a file and omit the filename on input
   - type `x` to add/remove file/directory to cut clipboard
   - type `c` to add/remove file/directory to copy clipboard
   - type `y` will copy name to system clipboard
   - type `Y` will copy relative path to system clipboard
   - type `gy` will copy absolute path to system clipboard
   - type `p` to paste from clipboard. Cut clipboard has precedence over copy (will prompt for confirmation)
   - type `d` to delete a file (will prompt for confirmation)
   - type `]c` to go to next git item
   - type `[c` to go to prev git item
   - type `-` to navigate up to the parent directory of the current file/directory
   - if the file is a directory, `<CR>` will open the directory otherwise it will open the file in the buffer near the tree
   - if the file is a symlink, `<CR>` will follow the symlink (if the target is a file)
   - `<C-v>` will open the file in a vertical split
   - `<C-x>` will open the file in a horizontal split
   - `<C-t>` will open the file in a new tab
   - `<Tab>` will open the file as a preview (keeps the cursor in the tree)
   - `I` will toggle visibility of folders hidden via |g:nvim_tree_ignore|
   - `H` will toggle visibility of dotfiles (files/folders starting with a `.`)
   - `R` will refresh the tree
   - Double left click acts like `<CR>`
   - Double right click acts like `<C-]>`
